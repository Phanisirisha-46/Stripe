## Description
This project demonstrates how to integrate Stripe’s payment gateway for processing online transactions. With Stripe, users can securely make payments using credit cards, debit cards, and other supported payment methods. The integration includes steps for both frontend and backend setup, ensuring a seamless and secure transaction experience.

## Steps to Integrate Stripe

### 1. Set Up a Stripe Account
- Go to [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and create an account.
- After signing in, find your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key** in the Stripe Dashboard.

### 2. Install Dependencies
- Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
- Install required dependencies for your project.

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
- Create a `.env` file in your project root directory and add your Stripe API keys (Publishable Key and Secret Key).

### 4. Frontend Integration
- Include Stripe.js in your frontend files to enable secure payment processing.
- Use Stripe Elements to securely collect payment details from users.
- Handle form submissions by creating a payment token and sending it to your backend.

### 5. Backend Integration
- Set up your backend to handle payments with the Stripe Node.js library (or relevant library for your backend language).
- Create a route to process payments and securely interact with the Stripe API.

### 6. Test the Integration
- Use Stripe’s test card numbers for testing payments in the development environment.
- Verify that the frontend and backend are communicating correctly and processing payments successfully.

### 7. Deploy Your Application
- Once everything is tested, deploy your application to your production environment.
- Make sure to update to live Stripe API keys in production.
